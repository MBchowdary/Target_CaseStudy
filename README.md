I've followed MVVM pattern.
Used Architecture components like ViewModel and LiveData
Used the following 3rd party libs:

1) Retrofit for making network calls
2) GSON for parsing the network data
3) Picasso for loading images
4) RxJava for reactive programing of async calls
5) NavGraph for managing fragments
